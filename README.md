An e-commerce website is an online platform that enables businesses and individuals to buy and sell goods and services over the internet. This type of website can range from a simple, single-product storefront to a complex, multi-vendor marketplace like Amazon or Flipkart. The core functionalities of an e-commerce website typically include product listings, a shopping cart, user authentication, and payment processing.
